JOSH DELIVERABLES:
Classroom_
Like I mentioned earlier, this should be one movement - zoom out from the back of the class until the two are in focus. Don't move the camera down like the car, just pull back, so the viewer can get a sense off moving through space. Thus giving a sense of a third dimension to a flat drawing.

Test changing plaintext on phone

BUGS IMPACTING USERS:
narration infinite loop
fix accelerometer stuff on device
accelerometer - detect orientation and swap x/y accordingly.(or lock orientation)
make readalong text highlighting work on device - remove the width DOM call! sort out the setContent call! Breaking the bounding box!

TODOS:

add swipe transitioning in app code with cool transition
