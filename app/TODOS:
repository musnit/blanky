overflow-hidden bug: https://github.com/Famous/famous/issues/493 


TODOS:
null/zerochecks for the different values used on popupview/camera/...
DRY the popupview and camera modifier code. well like literally CR all files.
add swipe transitioning in app code with cool transition
remove all globalz!
add narration/title screen and other screens/readalong/sort out timing/make timing reset at page start and go properly/make accelerometer position reset at page start and on big motions
fix accelerometer stuff on device
accelerometer - detect orientation and swap x/y accordingly.
ideas
for debugging: show values for stuff live
