Features needed:
control start and end of animation positions, rather than midpoint? think about timeline based/ tweening between keyframes/ my way now which is just like choosing range (ie, start and end keyframe), and sin between those points, and buggy offset
choose zoom origin?

..relative animations/numbers rather than absolute?
overflow-hidden bug: https://github.com/Famous/famous/issues/493 

accelerometer - detect orientation and swpa x/y accordingly.
accelerometer - test factor to multiply x/y translation when using real device.
TODOS:
null/zerochecks for the different values used on popupview/camera/...
add accelerometer control
DRY the popupview and camera modifier code. well like literally CR all files.
split app code from main code
add swipe transitioning in app code with cool transition
add sound controls
remove all globalz!
cordova and build as real app and test on my phone
add remaining pages
add narration/title screen and other screens/readalong/sort out timing/make timing reset at page start and go properly/make accelerometer position reset at page start and on big motions


pages:


-- self -- fix weird 0 index bug/zoom vs translate thing on the car page and then see...
make cut tech work proper - need actualy function to start/end continuously
add full screen zoom tech

car vibrating
smoke stretch/growing
do suttle full screen zoom on car page
tweak the flow of car page to deal with issues near end of animation josh dislikes
do suttle hands tilting on hands page
sound effects - car page, and children laughing, pirate swords, birds in classroom
