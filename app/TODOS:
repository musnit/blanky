JOSH DELIVERABLES:
Classroom_
Like I mentioned earlier, this should be one movement - zoom out from the back of the class until the two are in focus. Don't move the camera down like the car, just pull back, so the viewer can get a sense off moving through space. Thus giving a sense of a third dimension to a flat drawing.

BUGS IMPACTING USERS:
fix this mathfunction thing idk
make readalong text highlighting work on device - remove the width DOM call! sort out the setContent call! Breaking the bounding box!
use famous's timing
fix accelerometer stuff on device
accelerometer - detect orientation and swap x/y accordingly.(or lock orientation)

BUGS NOT IMPACTING TOO MUCH/IMPACTING ONLY ME:
overflow-hidden bug: https://github.com/Famous/famous/issues/493

TODOS:
make timing reset at page start and go properly and reset properly
proper readalong/sort out timing
add swipe transitioning in app code with cool transition
add narration/title screen and other screens
make accelerometer position reset at page start and on big motions..or something for better ux

TECH/RELIABILITY/REFACTOR:
null/zerochecks for the different values used on popupview/camera/...
DRY the popupview and camera modifier code. well like literally CR all files.
remove all globalz!

IDEAS:
for debugging: show values for stuff live
